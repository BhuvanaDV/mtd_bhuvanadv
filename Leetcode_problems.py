Companies
Hint
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 
### Answer
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_map = {}

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]

            if complement in num_map:
                return [num_map[complement], i]

            num_map[nums[i]] = i

2. Richest Customer Wealth
Companies
Hint
You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.
Example 1:

Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
Example 2:

Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
Example 3:

Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
 

Constraints:

m == accounts.length
n == accounts[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 50
1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100

### answer 
class Solution:
    def maximumWealth(self, accounts: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        max_wealth = 0

        for customer in accounts:
            wealth = sum(customer)
            if wealth > max_wealth:
                max_wealth = wealth


        return max_wealth

Easy

Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "IceCreAm"

Output: "AceCreIm"

Explanation:

The vowels in s are ['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']. On reversing the vowels, s becomes "AceCreIm".

Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: "leotcede"

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consist of printable ASCII characters.

### answer
class Solution:
    def reverseVowels(self, s: str) -> str:
        vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
        s = list(s)

        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1

        while left < right:

            while left < right and s[left] not in vowels:
                left += 1

            while left < right and s[right] not in vowels:
                right -= 1

            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]

            left += 1
            right -= 1

        return "".join(s)

Hint
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
### answer
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)

        answer = [1] * n

        # Prefix products
        prefix = 1
        for i in range(n):
            answer[i] = prefix
            prefix *= nums[i]

        # Suffix products
        suffix = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            answer[i] *= suffix
            suffix *= nums[i]

        return answer

Problem no-55. 
Jump Game
You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= 105

### answer
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        max_reach = 0

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i > max_reach:
                return False

            max_reach = max(max_reach, i + nums[i])

        return True

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ones = 0
        twos = 0

        for num in nums:
            ones = (ones ^ num) & ~twos

Example 2:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false

Hint
Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true
 

Constraints:

Problem no-724
724. Find Pivot Index
Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.
The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.
Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The pivot index is 3.
Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,1,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The pivot index is 0.
Left sum = 0 (no elements to the left of index 0)
Right sum = nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + -1 = 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

## answer
class Solution:
    def pivotIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        left_sum = 0

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            right_sum = total_sum - left_sum - nums[i]

            if left_sum == right_sum:
                return i

            left_sum += nums[i]

        return -1

You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75000
Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5], k = 1
Output: 5.00000
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= k <= n <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104

## answer
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:

392. Is Subsequence
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
