Hint
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 
### Answer
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_map = {}

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]

            if complement in num_map:
                return [num_map[complement], i]

            num_map[nums[i]] = i

2. Richest Customer Wealth
Companies
Hint
You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.
Example 1:

Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
Example 2:

Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
Example 3:

Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
 

Constraints:

m == accounts.length
n == accounts[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 50
1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100

### answer 
class Solution:
    def maximumWealth(self, accounts: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        max_wealth = 0

        for customer in accounts:
            wealth = sum(customer)
            if wealth > max_wealth:
                max_wealth = wealth


        return max_wealth

3. Reverse Vowels of a String
Easy

Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "IceCreAm"

Output: "AceCreIm"

Explanation:

The vowels in s are ['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']. On reversing the vowels, s becomes "AceCreIm".

Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: "leotcede"

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consist of printable ASCII characters.

### answer
class Solution:
    def reverseVowels(self, s: str) -> str:
        vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
        s = list(s)

        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1

        while left < right:

            while left < right and s[left] not in vowels:
                left += 1

            while left < right and s[right] not in vowels:
                right -= 1

            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]

            left += 1
            right -= 1

        return "".join(s)

Hint
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
### answer
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)

        answer = [1] * n

        # Prefix products
        prefix = 1
        for i in range(n):
            answer[i] = prefix
            prefix *= nums[i]

        # Suffix products
        suffix = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            answer[i] *= suffix
            suffix *= nums[i]

        return answer
